Minetest Nibirus SubGame [nibirus_subgame]
========================================
More one subgame for the Minetest engine
========================================

To use this subgame with the Minetest engine, insert this repository as
	/games/nibirus

The Minetest engine can be found in:
	https://github.com/Lunovox/minetest_nibirus_game

Compatibility
--------------
The Minetest Game github master HEAD is generally compatible with the github
master HEAD of the Minetest engine.

Additionally, when the Minetest engine is tagged to be a certain version (eg.
0.4.16), Minetest Game is tagged with the version too.

When stable releases are made, Minetest Game is packaged and made available in
	http://minetest.net/download
and in case the repository has grown too much, it may be reset. In that sense,
this is not a "real" git repository. (Package maintainers please note!)
